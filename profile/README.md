# Google Colaboratory Documentation
Google Colaboratory Documentation is as its name says, a documentation where you can find several types of practices and information for your development in Google Colab. This project was created mostly for new users who want to get started with Python and Jupiter Notebook using this environment. However, I hope you find these documentations useful.

## Contribution
If you want to support this project, be sure to read the contribution repository (comming soon...). Thanks. 

## Repositories
The repository named `google-colab-docs` contains the source code of the web page. That is, all the code for VitePress, Markdown, etc. And the `colab-docs.github.io` repository contains the documentations but already converted to HTML in order to upload it to GitHub Pages and use it as a web page.
